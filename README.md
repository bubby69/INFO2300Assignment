This adventure game starts off with any user input. Once user enters a text, the first text is displayed which details what the game is about and how to play.
This simple adventure game lets the user select a path from a choice of paths. Each of which leads to a challenge. 
You have to pass through all the paths in a particular order to win the game.

Follow this by opening it on a suitable IDE such as Visual Code. Run "npm install" to install the dependencies. Use the "npm start" command to start the application on your desired browser.
